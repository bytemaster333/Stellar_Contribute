Design a modern, developer-focused web UI prototype for a contributor reputation platform called "StellaRank", built for the Stellar blockchain community. The dashboard should display mock data to simulate activity and contributions.

The UI should include the following key sections as tabs or cards:

1. **Home Dashboard (Overview):**
   - Total contributors
   - Average contribution score
   - Top badges issued
   - Recent activity feed (mock usernames, actions like “posted on forum”, “committed code”, “invoked contract”)
   - Simple charts for weekly contribution trends (line chart) and badge distribution (donut/pie chart)

2. **Contributor Leaderboard:**
   - A sortable table of contributor usernames, wallet address, total score, GitHub activity score, forum score, on-chain activity score
   - Include badge icons next to names (like “Soroban Expert”, “Top Forum Helper”)

3. **Contributor Profile Page (when clicked):**
   - Username, wallet, bio (optional)
   - Contribution timeline (calendar heatmap or activity list)
   - Badges earned (with labels)
   - AI-generated “Contribution Summary” (mock output like: “Focused on Soroban contracts and helping in the Turkish community forum.”)

4. **Badge Explorer:**
   - Grid of all possible badges with descriptions
   - Example: “Forum Helper” – Earned by 10+ meaningful forum replies
   - Indicate which users earned each badge (mock counts)

5. **Map View (Geographic Contributions):**
   - World map highlighting countries with highest contribution counts
   - Optional toggle: “heatmap” vs “flag pin markers”

6. **Mentor Directory:**
   - List of top contributors who opted in as mentors
   - Cards showing their area of expertise and a “Connect” button (mockup only)

Use a clean, dark theme with developer-style aesthetics (like GitHub or Dune). Use Stellar-themed visual elements like the XLM symbol or Soroban color palette. Prioritize clarity and a modular layout. No need for real backend — use mock contributor names, wallet addresses, and scores.
